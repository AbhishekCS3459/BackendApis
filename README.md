## Introduction

The Backend Repository is a crucial part of our application. It handles data processing, business logic, and communication between the client-side and the server-side. The backend is responsible for managing databases, handling requests from the front-end, and ensuring the overall functionality of the application.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Backend Repository, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

1. Node.js - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Package Manager (npm or yarn)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/backend-repo.git
```

2. Change into the repository's directory:

```
cd backend-repo
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```
npm install
```
or if you are using yarn:

```
yarn install
```

4. Configure the necessary environment variables. You may find a sample `.env.example` file in the repository. Rename it to `.env` and update the values as needed.

5. Start the server:

```
npm start
```
or with yarn:

```
yarn start
```

Congratulations! The backend server is now up and running.

## Project Structure

The backend repository is organized as follows:

```
/backend-repo
  |-- /src                  # Source files for backend
  |     |-- /controllers    # Controllers handling request/response logic
  |     |-- /models         # Database models and schema definitions
  |     |-- /routes         # API routes and endpoint handlers
  |     |-- /services       # Business logic and services
  |     |-- app.js          # Main application file
  |     |-- server.js       # Server configuration and entry point
  |-- .env.example          # Example environment variables (Rename to .env)
  |-- package.json          # Node.js package file
  |-- README.md             # This file
```
